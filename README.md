ParaTranz exported JSON to Minecraft Language JSON Converter

Only for my private project. Tweaks are needed to use outside.

Generated by GPT-4

And yes it's working.
I know there are better ways I just felt like farming GPT

## Usage
1. Download generated zip containing language files in ParaTranz format from ParaTranz
2. Drag and drop the zip to drag_and_drop.bat
3. Wait till it's done
- Write a directory to ```output.txt``` like ```C:\test``` and the output ```scracherry``` folder will be directly copied to it
